# Daily UI: 012

**Task**

Design an e-commerce shop. Is it simple for a local business or a large online retailer? Is it for clothing, shoes, handmade soap, or something else?

Consider the brand, the products offered, product views, product options, desired actions (conversions, product views, etc.) and the users! (As always, it's up to you!)

A coworker showed me a trick in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) that allows one to layer artboards and have them export as you see it. It's a pretty cool trick that allows for exporting a design to share with some kind of frame. I may also try this later for testing user flows.

I also wanted to try a design that used more "natural" colors. I have been using a lot of bright colors lately.

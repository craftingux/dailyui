I'm finding that I like [Adobe Experience Design (XD)](http://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html) quite a bit. I feel like I can move in it much faster than [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com). If they can get a few more features in there and knock out a few annoying bugs, I may resubscribe to the [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html) again, just for this app.
